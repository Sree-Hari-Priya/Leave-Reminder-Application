## Leave Reminder Application
CS5704 Software Engineering Final Project

#### <ins>Description:<ins>

- This application simplifies the process of monitoring leaves during the COVID-19 epidemic for employees. It recalls and encourages users to take breaks from work to maintain their mental health and well-being. This program assists the user by displaying the number of leaves in a calendar year as well as the remaining leaves. The user can keep track of the leaves more easily this way. By presenting the leaves on the website, the user may quickly schedule the leaves without having to travel all the way to the calendar. We can retain the mental health of the user by keeping track of leaves and maintaining a minimum of two leaves every month.
